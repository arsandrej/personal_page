            <h3>Star wars</h3>
            <p>
            I'm also a huge fan of Star Wars, finding its rich universe and franchise incredibly fascinating.
            Two of my favourite characters in the story involve Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
            Their impelling backstories as well as their massive impact towards the story is what makes the
            Star Wars universe enjoyable.

            <h3>Berserk </h3>
            <img src="img/s44d42htdv371.png" alt="slika">
            <p>
            I also can`t forget about one of my favourite interests which is the manga Berserk.
            I love "Berserk" because of its profound storytelling, intricate world-building,
            and the depth of its characters. The dark, gritty atmosphere and intense, action-packed sequences
            captivate me, but it’s the journey of the main character, Guts, that truly resonates with me.
            His relentless struggle against overwhelming odds, combined with his unwavering determination
            and complex humanity, make him a truly compelling protagonist. The manga's exploration of themes
            like friendship, sacrifice, and the nature of good and evil adds layers of
            emotional and philosophical depth that keep me constantly engaged
            and deeply invested in the story.

                <h3>Batman Arkham Trilogy</h3>
                <p>The Batman Arkham trilogy holds a special place in my heart.
                    These games offer an immersive experience that captures the essence of being the Dark Knight.
                    Each game in the trilogy – Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight – builds on its predecessor, creating a rich,
                    interconnected storyline that keeps you engaged from start to finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favourite aspect of this game is how it combines stealth, combat, and detective work in a thrilling narrative.
                    The voice acting, particularly Mark Hamill's Joker and Kevin Conroy's Batman,
                    adds depth and authenticity to the characters.
                </p>
                <p>t perfectly blends action, exploration, and storytelling.
                    The combat system is fluid and satisfying, the gadgets are fun to use,
                    and the atmospheric environments make you feel like you're truly in Gotham City.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Ghost of Tsushima</h3>
               <p>Ghost of Tsushima, is another favorite that stands out for its
                   breathtaking visuals and engaging gameplay. Set in feudal Japan,
                   the game follows Jin Sakai,
                   a samurai warrior fighting to liberate the island of Tsushima from Mongol invaders.
               </p>
                <p>
                    The narrative is compelling, depicting Jin's struggle between honoring the samurai code and adopting unconventional tactics to save his homeland.
                    The character development is rich, with memorable supporting characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ghost of Tsushima isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. Its blend of history,
                    culture, and engaging
                    gameplay creates a journey that’s both emotionally impactful and incredibly fun to play.
